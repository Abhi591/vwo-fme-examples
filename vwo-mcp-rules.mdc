## 🎯 User Response Condition
If user wants to add a new variation value, then use tool.

## 🎯 User Response Condition (after variation creation)
After a new variation is added:

1. **Attach Metric Step (Required):**
   - Prompt the user:
     > Would you like to select an existing metric or create a new one to attach to this feature flag?

   - If user chooses to **use available metrics**:
     - Fetch all available metrics using the tool.
     - If there are available metrics:
       - Prompt the user to select which metric they want to use and update the feature-flag.
     - If no available metrics are found:
       - Inform the user that no metrics are available and prompt them to create a new metric.

   - If user chooses to **create a new metric**:
     - Ask the user for the name of the new metric.
     - update the metric to the feature-flag.

   - This step is compulsory; the user must attach one metric before proceeding.

2. **Rule Creation Loop:**

   Enter a loop for each rule type in sequence:

   1. **Rollout Rules:**
      - Prompt: > Would you like to create a rollout rule for this feature flag? (e.g., gradual rollout)
      - If yes: Fetch environment list using tool, ask for environment to use, ask for rule details, create the rule, ask if the rule should be enabled, and repeat this step.
      - If no: Move to Testing/Personalize Rules.

   2. **Testing/Personalize Rules:**
      - Loop: Prompt: > Would you like to create a testing or personalize rule for this feature flag? (e.g., A/B test or targeting specific users)
      - If yes: Ask which type (testing or personalize), get details, create the rule, ask if the rule should be enabled, and repeat this step.
      - If no: Ask If feature flag should be enabled to start using the feature, if the user confirms then toggle the feature flag using tool.
